This directory contains files that are local to this machine.
They should not be put into version control system nor transferred automatically between hosts.

Files from prod/  subdirectory are always loaded.
Files from dev/   subdirectory are loaded when :dev environment is set.
Files from admin/ subdirectory are loaded when :admin environment is set.
Files from test/  subdirectory are loaded when :test environment is set.

Typical use is to set :node key of a map keyed as :ferment.app/properties to name a host
and set paths that will only work on this machine (like caches or directories for model data).
